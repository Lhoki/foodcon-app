Playing with Slack API and Python

Base code used for a basic Python Slackbot found [here](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html)

If you're a rando, go away.

## Pre-requisites (I think)

* [Python 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/) - If you're a setting up Python for the first time, be sure to use the installer and ensure you install PIP and add Python to the PATH.
* PIP - Get that from installing Python
* virtualenv - Type the following command in a git BASH window `pip install virtualenv`
* slackclient - Type the following command in a git BASH window `pip install slackclient`
* Slack
